# D_Raylib_Zombie_Game
 A post apocalyptic first person survival game written in D with Raylib


### **Please note:** I am a programmer, not an artist. The base game will be an absolute bodge of assets for now.

I'm also practicing pure OOP for this. So it might look strange!

## Project goals:
0. Fun
1. Clean code
2. Easy to understand
3. Built on mods (But what language for modding, I don't know)
4. Map editor, somehow
5. Optimizated
